# Next Topic or questions
1. multiple reducer or state: the use case should be to work with multiple objects. In this case, how to set that up?


# Saga effect
1. Fork:  performs a non-blocking operation on the function passed.
1. Take:  pauses until action received.
1. Race:  runs effects simultaneously, then cancels them all once one finishes.
1. Call:  runs a function. If it returns a promise, pauses the saga until the promise is resolved.
1. Put:  dispatches an action.
1. Select:  Runs a selector function to get data from the state
1. takeLatest:  means we are going to execute the operations, then return only the results of the last one call. If we trigger several cases, itâ€™s going to ignore all of them except the last one.
1. takeEvery:  will return results for all the calls triggered.
